In my current job at [Disco Tray Studios](https://discotraystudios.github.io/), I've been tasked with polishing a preexisting site. Much of it has been going into the minutia of code, figuring out exactly where the problem area is, and changing a few lines of code. Y'know, basic computer science work stuff, letting me go through the motions of Doing Computer Science without really forcing me to stretch my brain muscles too much. Honestly, it's comfortable in a folding clothes sort of way. But like the laundry pile, so to do easy bugs and features eventually run out. And so, I ventured into the new frontier of user testing. I dragged my folks in front of the screen, gave them the general context of the site and set them lose to see how they would react.

Things didn't go well. It was clear from their behavior that what we'd spent quite a lot of time on was hard to navigate and unclear in both purpose and effect. I've seen this sort of reaction before, and it got me to thinking about how this sort of thing happens.

When we read a book, the author assumes quite a bit of knowledge on the reader's part. Kick a dog, you're bad. Help an old lady cross the street, you're good. At an even more basic level, authors assume an understanding of the English language. In the same way, programmers make applications for use by everyday people we assume a certain amount of knowledge from the user. Specialists in any field, but especially that of technology, spend so much time working in our element, that we risk becoming blind to the assumptions we make. Paradoxically, sometimes the best way to improve our work is to give our minds a chance to breathe, and let an outside perspective in.
