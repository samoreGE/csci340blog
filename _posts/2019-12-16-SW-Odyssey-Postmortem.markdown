Of all the skills I gained in this class, I'd say that the collaborative mindset I acquired and honed while working both with a client and in a group. I'm confident in my own programming skills, but I'm only human, so learning how best to work in this real-world context will doubtlessly be helpful. 

Looking back, it's obvious that this project was of a relatively small scope. We sought to improve the quality of a single organization in a single institution regarding a single relevant type of data. Therefore, the need was similarly narrow. With that context, I'm quite proud of the approaches my team took when enacting that change. Though the jury is still out on whether the whole thing will be implemented for next semester, it will streamline many of the current problems if it is.

I can't say that this experience particularly challenged my believes or values. However, I will say that the academic coursework was vital. This class has given me an understanding of the complexity required to approach this type of problem, and I'll be using that knowledge throughout the rest of my time here at Hendrix and beyond.

Something that was clear from the client's original solution was that, when it comes getting long-term feedback regarding any sort of goal, the method by which that feedback is gained is very important, as is what the feedback is prompted by. Due to the nature of the class, much more time was spent discussing how we would ask for the information than what exactly we were asking in the first place. Though the latter is likely a more impactful issue, the former's focus in our project showed me how much i had undervalued the means by which we ask for feedback.
