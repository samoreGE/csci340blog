This week, the challenge was to replace the basic Minima theme that comes with Jekyll with a different, more powerful theme sourced from the internet. I first tried to work with Massively, but ended up making some misteps that ended up with me having to re-download an old version of the entire site from the github. In the end, I ended up using [Long Haul][Long-Haul], since its implementation was relatively simple and the website's aesthetic was something I quite enjoyed.

Like with the previous lab, I have no prior experience with the relevant parts of the lab, but after switching to Long Haul, the process was much easier. I'm not quite sure how the various instances of certain pages mesh together, but the basics make sense. Strangely, the biggest hurdle I encountered was fighting my own indecision in choosing a header image. Luckily, I found the following one from the always-helpful [SnappyGoat].
