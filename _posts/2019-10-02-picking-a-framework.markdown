This last week and a half has consisted of learning about the various frameworks we could use to create our websites. After all teams had presented, my team met to discuss which ones we prefered to work with. Listed below, in ascending order of preference, is an overview of each of the frameworks.

**Express** is the least far-reaching framwork in terms of what is premade. This means that there is a lot we would have to do ourselves in implementation. Though there are 3rd party add-ons that allow for reading/writing, the limitations of the framework made this a suboptimal options.

The next language, **Ruby on Rails**, handles much more of the back-end than Express. That being said, several of my teammates mentioned concern with how certain coding changes are made, along with what would be required to implement, so we moved on to looking at the other options.

I was part of the group presenting **ASP.NET**, which uses C#. This is the first framework on the list where we all agreed that it allowed for easy changes to the site. However, it's a framework made by Microsoft, and concerns with how it may interact with a non-Windows server made us look to other options.

**Flask** uses Python, which we were all familiar with, as does **Django**. My team discussed the advantages of both options, and after looking at the support each had online, we were leaning toward Django. However, there was a better option on the table.

**Laravel** would be our final decision. Not only does it work off PHP, which will mesh with some of the querying we're doing, but it also does some of the background work itself, a few of our team are already familiar with it, and it's simple to implement.
