Setting up this blog was one of the more challenging computer science tasks I've needed to complete. Using the console has never really been my strong suit, and I've done everything i can in past projects to avoid it, but that obviously wasn't possible here.

To my surprise, however, navigating and using the console was actually pretty simple, and other than the gemfile.txt fiasco, I had no trouble following the instructions.

All that being said, I must admit that my execution of the instructions does not reflect comprehension of the bigger concepts at play. There were several points in this project where that became clear, centered around 3 main issues.

1. Lack of familiarity with the basic functions of the console
2. Confusion about the specific usage of jekyll (sadly, [the site][jekyll-site] wasn't much help)
3. Confusion about the purpose of Ruby (again, [the ruby site][ruby-site] didn't clear too much up.
