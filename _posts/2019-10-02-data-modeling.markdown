This week, I needed to model the auction in both Draw.io and Vertabello, the results of which may be seen below.

![Draw.io chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samoreGE/csci340blog/master/assets/img/drawio.png "Draw.io chart")
![Vertabello chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samoreGE/csci340blog/master/assets/img/vertabello.png "Vertabello chart")

I'm confident that I can look at these charts and undersand how I would make a set of SQL tables to represent the original prompt, but I am unsure how close to that final group of tables these charts are.
