Hey! my name is Griffith Samore, and this is my website. I'm a student in Dr. Goadrich's class my first semester of my Junior year, and to wmake sure we know how to use Jekyll and Ruby to make a website. Interested in Jekyll? find out more at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)!

The theme I used for this blog is [Long Haul](http://brianmaierjr.com/long-haul) by [Brian Maier Jr.](https://brianmaierj)
